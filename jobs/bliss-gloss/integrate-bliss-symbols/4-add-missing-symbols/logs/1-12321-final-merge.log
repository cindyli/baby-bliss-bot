Glosses in words: [' a', ' an', ' any']
Target tokens: ['Ġa', 'Ġan', 'Ġany']; Target token IDs: [264, 459, 904]
Loaded model and tokenizer from the latest model dir: /home/cindyli/projects/ctb-whkchun/s2_bliss_LLMs/integrate_bliss_symbols/1_single_gloss_model
New token '[BLISS_12321]' added to the model with ID: 130624. Embeddings will be initialized later.
Calculated output embedding for the new token
Output embedding of the new token '[BLISS_12321]' set to the calculated output embedding
Input embedding of the new token '[BLISS_12321]' set to the average input embedding of all constituent tokens of '[' a', ' an', ' any']'
